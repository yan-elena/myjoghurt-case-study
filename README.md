# MyJoghurt Case Study
This repository contains a case study illustrating the practical potential of the extended normative programming language [NPL(s)](https://github.com/moise-lang/npl) with **sanctions** as first-class abstraction integrated into the JaCaMo BDI agent architecture. More details are available in our research paper titled "An Agent-Centric Perspective on Norm Enforcement and Sanctions".

This case study addresses the problem of the laboratory plant myJoghurt described in "Increasing Robustness of Agentsâ€™ Decision-Making in Production Automation using Sanctioning" [[link]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10217852).
